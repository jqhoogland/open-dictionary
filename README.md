# Open Dictionary

üìñ [Open Dictionary](https://open-dictionary.vercel.app/) is structured, machine-readable [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/). 

## üöÄ Start here

- Check out the [Python Client](/wiktionary).

Come back soon to check out:
- [Semantic Triples]()
- A REST API
- Or GraphQL API.
- And Typescript Client.

With these, you'll find:
- Better tools for NLP ‚Äî built-in semantic web visualization, lemmatizers & tokenizers, etc. 
- Better tools for language-learning ‚Äî finding translations, pronunciations, and word frequency lists.

## ‚ò†Ô∏è The Problem
Wiktionary has no API.[^1] 

[^1]: It [actually has an api](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php), but the api returns an unworkable sludge of html or [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext).

As a result, querying Wiktionary programmatically has required a parser like [this one](https://github.com/Suyash458/WiktionaryParser). 
This is not ideal since these parsers work with outputted html rather than raw [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext).

There's also the problem that Wiktionaries vary in standards across languages, so existing parsers are Wiktionary-specific. They throw out a lot of valuable data. 

## üèó The Solution

We provide tools to convert [wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) into queryable ["semantic triples"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple)
and then expose these via easy-to-use APIs.

On top of that, we (will eventually) offer a few other niceties like tools to visualize the graph of words, lemmatize inflected forms, etc. It's going to be the best dictionary on the planet.

These triples serve as a kind of language-agnostic compile target for different wiktionaries, which means we can eventually consolidate all wiktionaries into one consistent format.

(The tools translate readily to Wikipedia, so feel free to intiative with that follow-up.)
