# Word Frequency Lists

Word's obey [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). The most common words are *much* more common than the least common words.

In practice, this means that you only need "around 2000" words to understand most everyday speech. So it makes sense to begin with the most common words (rather than obscure fruits & vegetables).

The aim of the list in this directory is to provide a useful modified set of words, that can serve as your initial base of vocab in any language.

It still needs work as the list is alphabetical (i.e., not ordered by frequency), and it's somewhat arbitrary. Parts of it are based on a word frequency list, but other parts are filled in by github copilot (so only indirectly from a word frequency list).

The small amount of code in this directory is to use google translate to derive a first pass translation of this word list in any language.
